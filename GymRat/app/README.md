# First Iteration
User story – Create custom workout
  - This function allows the user to create his/her own custom workout routine to enhance their exercises and reach their goals faster.       Once we complete the SQL database, this function will allow the user to select multiple exercises and add them to a workout and store     that workout under their account, in the activity "My Workouts", which has not been implemented yet.
  
User story – Lifting Tips
  - This activity allows the user to browser a variety of exercises and see tips to better the form and overall affect of the exercise. If     the user likes the description of the exercise and does not have it in one of their workouts, they can choose the "Add to Workout"         option to add it to one of their saved workouts. Since we haven't implemented the SQL database or "My Workouts" activity, the screen       goes to the "Create custom workout" activity.
  
User story – Login and Logout
  - This allows the user to login and out with his/her email address and password. Once the SQL database is set up, this will store user accounts and passwords along with their information, custom workouts, etc.
